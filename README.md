# Fruit Defect Detection

Fruit Defect Detection is a web application that allows users to upload images of various fruits (e.g., apples, bananas, oranges) and receive predictions on the fruit's quality (e.g., fresh or rotten). The application uses deep learning models to perform fruit classification based on the selected fruit type.
